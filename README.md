# Random Password Generator Utilizing Javascript
## Description

Need a random and secure password? This repo contains all of the code needed to showcase a fully functional random password generator, with a heavy focus on javascript concepts and how to apply them in conjunction with HTML and CSS.

## What Problem Did This Challenge Solve?

The main problem this challenge tackles as a developer is how to make multiple functions interact with eachother to complete a singular task, and how to properly format code in such a way that it is efficient, but also meets the criteria. It also solves the real-world problem of end users having to come up with a password all on their own. With this app, an end user can simply click a button, enter their criteria, and have a completely unique password created for them, ready to use any and every time.

## What Was Learned?

This challenge teaches a developer how to combine various javascript methods,functions, and concepts to solve complex problems in a simple and efficient way. For example, giving the end user the ability to choose what characters they would like in their password adds a level of complexity that encourages developers to research and apply javascript concepts they may not have known of or understood previously.
